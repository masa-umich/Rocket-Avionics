## Note:
Currently this code is the hacked together "droptest-firmware" written for the A&R droptest that iirc is cancelled. This is NOT the final limestone firmware, the final version will have many more features like networking, more sensors, an autosequence, etc. This is just a placeholder for now and is mostly meant to test the functionality of the hardware.
