 * // Scanning a new W25N01GV flash chip for bad memory blocks. You should
 * // only have to do this before writing to it for the very first time.
 * // If scan_bad_blocks() returns a nonzero value, there is at least 1
 * // corrupted memory block and you should consider using a different chip.

 * ============================================================================
 *
 * // Reading all of flash in 2KB chunks
 * // Note: the number of pages in flash is one greater than the maximum value
 * // of a uint16_t, so you either have to declare the page counter with at
 * // least 32bits or break out of the loop when the counter reaches
 * // W25N01GV_NUM_PAGES, or use some other control logic to avoid an infinite loop.
 *
 * uint32_t page = 0;
 * uint8_t read_buffer[2048];
 * reset_flash_read_pointer(&flash);
 *
 * while (page < W25N01GV_NUM_PAGES) {
 *   read_next_2KB_from_flash(&flash, read_buffer);
 *   // Data gets read into read_buffer, do something with it here
 * }
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * // Writing an array of bytes to flash
 * // Note: if there isn't enough space to write the data, anything over
 * // capacity will get cut off and won't be written.
 *
 * // You must call finish_flash_write() at the END of your program, before
 * // the W25N01GV_Flash struct goes out of scope, or else you could lose
 * // up to the last 512 bytes written. Do not call write_to_flash() anymore
 * // finish_flash_write() has been called.
 *
 * TODO: add more details on why this is the case.
 *
 * // data is a uint8_t array, num_bytes is the size of data
 * write_to_flash(&flash, data, num_bytes);
