## Note:
This is the location for the flight computer firmware for Limelight. This README will be updated more as the firmware is written. Currently the firmware is just an empty project that is configured for the flight computer. All peripherals, Ethernet, clock configuration, RTOS, and LWIP are set up, along with a collection of hardware drivers that have virtual folders linked to the board-drivers directory of this repo.
